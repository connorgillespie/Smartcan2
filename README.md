# Smartcan2

## About
The Smartcan was a project developed during my Freshman year biology class and focused on giving incentives to users who actively participate in recycling. The Smartcan2 was designed for the IoT internship at California State University of Fullerton. At the time of creation, I was a Junior in high school and had prior experience with PHP and Arduino programming. Instead of focusing on promoting recycling, the second version focuses on securing the device and providing remote configuration to better suite the role of an IoT device. The Smartcan2 software consists of a PHP dashboard and a Arduino Uno script that uses the ESP8266-01 to communicate over WiFi.
